    "Q1. What is Random Forest Regressor?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "Random Forest Regressor is an ensemble learning method that consists of a collection of decision trees. Each decision tree is trained on a random subset of the training data and a random subset of the features. The predictions of the individual decision trees are then aggregated to produce a final prediction."

    "\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "Random Forest Regressor reduces the risk of overfitting by training multiple decision trees on different subsets of the data. This helps to prevent the model from becoming too specialized to the training data and allows it to generalize better to new data."

    "\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "A Random Forest Regressor aggregates predictions of multiple decision trees by averaging their individual predictions for regression tasks. For each tree, predictions are made independently, and the final prediction is the average of these tree predictions, which helps reduce variance and improve accuracy."

    "Q5. What is the difference between Random Forest Regressor and Decision Tree Regressor?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "The main difference between Random Forest Regressor and Decision Tree Regressor is that Random Forest Regressor uses multiple decision trees to make predictions, while Decision Tree Regressor only uses a single decision tree. This makes Random Forest Regressor more robust to overfitting and less sensitive to noise in the data."
