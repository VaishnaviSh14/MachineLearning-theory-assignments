    "\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "A decision tree classifier is a supervised learning algorithm that uses a tree-like structure to make predictions. The tree is built by recursively splitting the data into smaller and smaller subsets based on the values of the features. The splitting process is repeated until all of the data points in a subset belong to the same class.\n",

    "To make a prediction, a decision tree classifier starts at the root node of the tree and follows the branches until it reaches a leaf node. The class label of the leaf node is the predicted class for the data point.\n",

    "The mathematical intuition behind decision tree classification is based on the idea of entropy. Entropy is a measure of uncertainty, and it can be used to quantify the amount of uncertainty in a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "A decision tree classifier works by reducing the entropy of the data by splitting it into smaller and smaller subsets. Each time the data is split, the entropy of the subset is reduced. The splitting process is repeated until the entropy of the subsets is zero, or until a certain stopping criterion is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "The stopping criterion is a rule that determines when the splitting process should stop. The most common stopping criterion is to stop when the entropy of the subsets is zero. However, other stopping criteria can be used, such as stopping when the number of data points in a subset is below a certain threshold."
