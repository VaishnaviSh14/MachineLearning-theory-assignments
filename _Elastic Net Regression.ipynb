    "Q1. What is Elastic Net Regression and how does it differ from other regression techniques?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "Elastic Net Regression is a regularized regression technique that combines the L1 and L2 penalties of Lasso and Ridge Regression. This makes it a versatile tool that can be used to address a variety of problems, such as overfitting, multicollinearity, and feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between Elastic Net Regression and other regression techniques is that it allows for both coefficient shrinkage and coefficient selection. Lasso Regression only allows for coefficient selection, while Ridge Regression only allows for coefficient shrinkage"
