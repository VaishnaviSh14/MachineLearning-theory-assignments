    "Ans.\n",
    "1.Train - The training set is a portion of the dataset used to train the machine learning model. The training set is of utmost importance because it is used to teach the model the underlying patterns and relationships within the data. The model's ability to learn from the training set will significantly impact its performance on new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Test - In this we test the model to see how model is performing with respect to accuracy.The model will never know about this dataset.. By evaluating the model on the test set, we can determine how well it performs on data it has not encountered before, ensuring that it is not just memorizing the training data but learning meaningful patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Validation - We perform hyperparameter tunning of the model.Here we tune some parameters of the model , so that our model's accuracy increases. It helps optimize the model's performance by allowing us to experiment with various hyperparameter configurations and select the best-performing model. \n"
