    "\n",
    "The main difference between the Euclidean distance metric and the Manhattan distance metric is that the Euclidean distance takes into account the squared differences between the corresponding features of two data points, while the Manhattan distance only takes into account the absolute differences. This means that the Euclidean distance is more sensitive to outliers than the Manhattan distance.\n",
