    "Multiple Linear Regression extends this concept by considering multiple independent variables to model the relationship with the dependent variable. In essence, it's an extension of simple linear regression to multiple predictors. Example: Predicting a house's price (dependent variable) based on its size, number of bedrooms, and location (independent variables)."
