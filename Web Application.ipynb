    "Traditional web hosting is when you rent space on a web server from a hosting provider. The hosting provider is responsible for managing the server and ensuring that it is always up and running. Cloud hosting is when you rent computing resources, such as CPU, memory, and storage, from a cloud provider. The cloud provider is responsible for managing the resources and ensuring that they are available when you need them.\n",
