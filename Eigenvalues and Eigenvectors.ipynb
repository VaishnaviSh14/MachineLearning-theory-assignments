    "\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "Eigenvectors are non-zero vectors that, when multiplied by a square matrix, result in a new vector that is a scaled version of the original vector. Mathematically, if v is an eigenvector of a matrix A with eigenvalue λ, then:\n",

Eigenvalues, on the other hand, provide information about how much the eigenvectors are scaled during this transformation. Together, eigenvectors and eigenvalues fully characterize the behavior of a linear transformation."
