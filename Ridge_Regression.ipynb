    "Q1. What is Ridge Regression, and how does it differ from ordinary least squares regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "Ridge regression is a type of linear regression that adds a regularization term to the loss function. This regularization term penalizes the size of the coefficients, which helps to prevent overfitting. Ordinary least squares regression does not have this regularization term, so it is more likely to overfit the data."

    "Q2. What are the assumptions of Ridge Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "Linearity: The relationship between the predictor variables and the target variable should be approximately linear. Ridge Regression, like linear regression, assumes that the target variable can be expressed as a linear combination of the predictor variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Independence: The residuals (the differences between the observed target values and the predicted values) should be independent of each other. This assumption implies that the errors for one observation do not influence the errors for other observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Homoscedasticity: Homoscedasticity refers to the assumption that the variance of the residuals should be constant across all levels of the predictor variables. In other words, the spread of the residuals should be similar regardless of the values of the predictor variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normality: The residuals should follow a normal distribution. This assumption is primarily important for hypothesis testing and constructing confidence intervals. However, Ridge Regression is often less sensitive to violations of normality compared to traditional linear regression due to its regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "No Multicollinearity: Multicollinearity occurs when predictor variables are highly correlated with each other. In Ridge Regression, multicollinearity can be problematic because it can lead to unstable coefficient estimates. Ridge Regression is designed to handle multicollinearity by adding regularization to the coefficients."

    "Q3. How do you select the value of the tuning parameter (lambda) in Ridge Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "The tuning parameter lambda controls the amount of regularization. A larger value of lambda will result in more shrinkage of the coefficients, while a smaller value of lambda will result in less shrinkage. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to selecting lambda, and the best value will depend on the specific data set."

    "Ans.\n",
    "Yes, ridge regression can be used for feature selection. The coefficients of the ridge regression model will be smaller for the features that are less important. This can be used to identify the features that can be dropped from the model without significantly affecting the model's performance.\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "Ridge regression is more robust to multicollinearity than ordinary least squares regression. This is because the regularization term penalizes the size of the coefficients, which helps to reduce the impact of multicollinearity."
