    "\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "The main difference between linear regression and logistic regression is that linear regression is used to predict a continuous value, while logistic regression is used to predict a categorical value. For example, linear regression could be used to predict the price of a house, while logistic regression could be used to predict whether a customer will click on an ad.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a scenario where logistic regression would be more appropriate:\n",
    "You want to predict whether a patient has a disease. The dependent variableis categorical (has two possible values: yes or no). In this case, linear regression would not be appropriate because it is not designed to predict categorical values. Logistic regression, on the other hand, is specifically designed for this task."

    "\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "Regularization is a technique that is used to prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when the model learns the training data too well and is unable to generalize to new data. Regularization adds a penalty to the cost function that discourages the model from learning too complex a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of regularization: L1 regularization and L2 regularization. L1 regularization penalizes the absolute values of the coefficients, while L2 regularization penalizes the square of the coefficients."

    "The ROC curve is a graphical representation of the performance of a binary classifier. It plots the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR). The TPR is the proportion of positive instances that are correctly classified, while the FPR is the proportion of negative instances that are incorrectly classified.\n",

    "The ROC curve is a useful tool for evaluating the performance of a logistic regression model. A good model will have a ROC curve that follows the upper left corner of the graph."
