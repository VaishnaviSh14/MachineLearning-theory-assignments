    "Boosting is an ensemble machine learning technique that combines a set of weak learners to create a strong learner. A weak learner is a classifier that is only slightly correlated with the true classification. A strong learner is a classifier that is arbitrarily well-correlated with the true classification."

    "The advantages of using boosting techniques include:\n",
    "1. Improved accuracy: Boosting can often improve the accuracy of a machine learning model by combining the predictions of multiple weak learners.\n",
    "2. Robustness to overfitting: Boosting can help to reduce the risk of overfitting by reweighting the training data so that the model pays more attention to the data points that are difficult to classify.\n",
    "3. Better handling of imbalanced data: Boosting can be used to handle imbalanced data by giving more weight to the minority class.\n",

    "The limitations of using boosting techniques include:\n",
    "1. Can be computationally expensive: Boosting can be computationally expensive, especially for large datasets.\n",
    "2. Can be sensitive to the choice of weak learner: The performance of boosting can depend on the choice of weak learner.\n",
