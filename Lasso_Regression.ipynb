    "Q1. What is Lasso Regression, and how does it differ from other regression techniques?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "Lasso regression is a type of linear regression that adds a regularization term to the loss function. This regularization term penalizes the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients, which helps to prevent overfitting and encourages sparsity in the model. Other regression techniques, such as ordinary least squares regression and ridge regression, do not have this regularization term.\n"

    "\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Lasso Regression model, the coefficients represent the relationship between the independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (target) while taking into account regularization. Lasso Regression adds a penalty term to the linear regression cost function, which encourages the model to shrink some coefficients to exactly zero. This has the effect of performing feature selection, as some features may be deemed less relevant and have their coefficients reduced to zero.\n",

This is because the L1 regularization term penalizes the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients, which forces some of the coefficients to zero.

The Lasso regression model is then fit to the training set and the performance of the model is evaluated on the test set. This process is repeated for different values of lambda and the value of lambda that results in the best performance on the test set is chosen as the optimal value of lambda."
