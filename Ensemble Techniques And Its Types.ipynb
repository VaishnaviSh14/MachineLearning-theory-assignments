    "Q1. How does bagging reduce overfitting in decision trees?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bagging reduces overfitting in decision trees by training multiple decision trees on different bootstrapped samples of the training data. This helps to prevent any one decision tree from becoming too specialized to the training data, and it also helps to average out the errors of the individual decision trees."

    "Ans.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few advantages to using different types of base learners in bagging. First, it can help to reduce the variance of the ensemble model. Second, it can help to improve the accuracy of the ensemble model in cases where the individual base learners are biased in different directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are also a few disadvantages to using different types of base learners in bagging. First, it can make the ensemble model more complex and difficult to interpret. Second, it can increase the computational cost of training the ensemble model."

    "Q3. How does the choice of base learner affect the bias-variance tradeoff in bagging?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of base learner affects the bias-variance tradeoff in bagging in a few ways. First, base learners with low bias tend to have high variance, and base learners with high bias tend to have low variance. Second, base learners that are more complex tend to have higher variance, and base learners that are less complex tend to have lower variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, bagging can help to reduce the variance of an ensemble model by training multiple base learners on different bootstrapped samples of the training data. However, bagging can also increase the bias of an ensemble model if the base learners are biased in the same direction."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "The ensemble size is the number of base learners that are included in the ensemble model. The ensemble size affects the bias-variance tradeoff of the ensemble model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, a larger ensemble size will reduce the variance of the ensemble model, but it will also increase the bias of the ensemble model. A smaller ensemble size will increase the bias of the ensemble model, but it will also reduce the variance of the ensemble model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimal ensemble size depends on the specific problem that is being solved. However, a good starting point is to use an ensemble size of 10-100 base learners."
