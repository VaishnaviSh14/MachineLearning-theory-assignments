In the dataset, we have 90% of customers who don't leave (majority class) and only 10% of customers who do leave (minority class). To up-sample the minority class, we duplicate or generate synthetic samples for the churned customers, making the number of churned and non-churned customers roughly equal.\n",

    "Continuing with the customer churn example, if we have an imbalanced dataset with 90% non-churned customers (majority class) and 10% churned customers (minority class), down-sampling would involve randomly removing some non-churned customers' data to make the class distribution more balanced.\n",

    "Outliers are data points that deviate significantly from the rest of the data in a dataset. They are extreme values that lie far away from the central tendency of the data distribution. Outliers can occur due to various reasons, such as measurement errors, data entry mistakes, natural variations, or even rare events.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Influence on Model Performance: In predictive modeling and machine learning, outliers can disproportionately influence model training. They may lead to overfitting, where the model learns to perform well only on the outlier-affected data but poorly on new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Skewed Analysis: Outliers can distort the distribution and spread of the data, leading to skewed analysis results and incorrect conclusions.\n",
